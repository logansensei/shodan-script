# Shodan Search Script

## Overview

This script allows you to perform searches on Shodan, a popular search engine for internet-connected devices. It rotates through multiple API keys and uses different user-agents to avoid hitting rate limits or getting blocked.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Shodan API Key(s)
- Internet connection

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install shodan`.
3. Run the script using Python: `python shodan_search.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the search query and API keys.

## Examples

Here are some example queries you can try:

1. Search for Apache servers:
   - Query: `apache`

2. Find Nginx servers:
   - Query: `nginx`

3. Search for Windows servers:
   - Query: `Microsoft Windows`

4. Look for Linux servers:
   - Query: `Linux`

5. Find IoT devices:
   - Query: `IoT`

## Adding Additional User Agents

If you want to add more user agents, open the script file and update the `get_random_user_agent()` function with additional user agent strings.

## Adding More API Keys

To add more API keys, simply provide them when prompted. The script will cycle through all the keys provided.

Make sure to replace `<example-query>` with actual examples and update any placeholders with specific information relevant to your script.

This README provides a basic overview of how to use the script, what it does, and how to add additional API keys or user agents.

Feel free to customize it further based on your specific needs or preferences!
